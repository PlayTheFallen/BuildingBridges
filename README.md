## Additional Notes

- The upload page for game jam stated that we should use CCv3 yet [the rules](https://globalgamejam.org/news/be-cool-rules) state CCv4. We do not know why this is the case, but hope it is resolved as soon as possible.
- We know of the issue with level 2 and plan to have this fixed in the [First Post Game Jam Release](https://github.com/PlayTheFallen/BuildingBridges/milestone/1).
